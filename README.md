Mainly, I grasp the concepts of loops, arrays, objects, functions, and variables. I think what I find challenging is when to use them
and sometimes how to distinguish objects, variables, and functions. I think as I use them more, I'll
become more familiar with them. 

I also would like to understand git remote a lot better. Each time, I must bypass a permissions issue to commit to my repo. This
causes me a bit of confusion about how it should work correctly.
